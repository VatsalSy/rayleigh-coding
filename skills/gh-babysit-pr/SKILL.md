# Babysit a PR

GitHub-workshop skill (CodeRabbit + Actions). If the remote is not GitHub,
stop and use the matching host skill (for Origin: `origin-babysit-pr`).

Own a PR as a standing watch until it is merge-ready: green checks, all
review threads resolved or declined-with-reason, approvals in, branch fresh.
This skill owns the LOOP only. The review discipline is single-sourced in
`git-master` → "Review babysitting discipline" (rules 1–8); follow it by
number, do not restate it.

## Optional merge-bot gate

```bash
# When set, require this login's APPROVED review on the exact head before
# reporting merge-ready (and before merging if pre-authorised).
# When unset, skip the merge-bot approve gate entirely.
MERGE_BOT_LOGIN="${MERGE_BOT_LOGIN:-}"
```

## Loop contract

1. **Baseline.** `gh pr view <n> --json headRefOid,statusCheckRollup,reviews,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus,mergeable,baseRefName,isDraft`
   (`reviewThreads` is NOT a `gh pr view` field — thread state needs GraphQL):

   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='query($o:String!,$r:String!,$n:Int!){repository(owner:$o,name:$r){pullRequest(number:$n){reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{isResolved}}}}}' \
     -F o=<owner> -F r=<repo> -F n=<n> \
     --jq '[.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]|select(.isResolved|not)]|length'
   ```

   Record the head SHA, the recorded `baseRefName`, and the counts. Note
   the user's original goal for the PR in one line; it is the scope anchor
   (rule 5) for every later decision. Before any write operation (fixes,
   rebases), `gh pr checkout <n>` — the repo may be sitting on the default
   branch after gh-pr-create's hand-off.
2. **Wait, don't spin—and stop waiting.** Prefer the harness's facility: in
   Claude Code use `/loop` self-paced or a Monitor; in Codex, bounded polls.
   Ordinary CI may use its normal runtime, but CodeRabbit gets at most ten
   cumulative minutes on one pushed head and fifteen cumulative minutes across
   the PR. Record both counters and the number of feedback-driven pushes; neither
   resets after compaction, a bot comment edit, or a new head. Allow at most
   two such fix pushes. Never busy-loop `gh` calls.
3. **On each wake**, act only on what is newer than the latest push (rule 2):
   - **New bot threads (CodeRabbit)** → `autofix`.
   - **CodeRabbit is incremental:** a normal push triggers review of that new
     commit range automatically and consumes rolling per-developer capacity.
     Batch validated fixes and any material base update into one meaningful
     push where practical; never push one fix at a time or manufacture a no-op
     push. Do not request a ceremonial/full review or revisit an already
     reviewed range. If the App is rate-limited, paused, or silent at the
     CodeRabbit cap, route the exact head to `autofix` for its bounded local
     fallback. Do not query quota, request a manual review, or wait beyond the
     cap here.
   - **Review BODIES, not just threads:** CodeRabbit puts nitpicks,
     outside-diff-range comments, and the full fix guidance in the review
     body (`gh api repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/<n>/reviews --jq '.[].body'`) — items
     there never become threads and a thread-only sweep misses them.
     Read new review bodies on every wake and triage their items like threads.
   - **New human threads** → `gh-address-comment`.
   - **Failing checks** → flake-triage first (rule 3), then `gh-fix-ci`
     (GitHub Actions) or report the external provider's details URL.
   - **Base drift** that is material (conflicts, or CI depends on new base
     commits) → rebase/merge the recorded `baseRefName` (not a hard-coded
     `main`) and re-push.
   - **Overlapping PR makes this one obsolete** → stop, report, ask (rule 6).
4. **Every declined thread gets a short written reason, signed
   `*<model-slug> on behalf of the user:*`, before resolution** (rule 4) —
   dismissals are the only signed comments. Never silently ignore or
   silently comply.
5. **Scope guard on every iteration:** compare the diff against the goal from
   step 1. If addressing feedback is growing the PR beyond it, decline with a
   reason instead of complying (rule 5).
6. **Final merge-bot gate (only when `MERGE_BOT_LOGIN` is set).** Once every
   other merge-ready condition below is satisfied, and the active request
   authorises shepherding the PR to merge, record the current head SHA and
   inspect `${MERGE_BOT_LOGIN}`'s reviews on that exact head. Take the latest
   *effective* state: `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and `DISMISSED` are
   decisive; a later `COMMENTED` review does not override them. If that state
   is `APPROVED`, skip the comment. If it is `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or
   `DISMISSED`, or there is no decisive review, post exactly
   `@${MERGE_BOT_LOGIN} approve?` as a PR comment. Poll comments and reviews with
   bounded waits for that login's `APPROVED` review tied to that head, for at
   most fifteen cumulative minutes. Do not busy-loop and do not extend or
   restart the deadline after compaction, transient replies, or repeated status
   checks. If the head changes, discard the old response and run this final
   gate again only after the new head is otherwise merge-ready. Proceed only on
   an unambiguous approval of the exact current head. On refusal,
   inconclusive response, or timeout, do not merge; stop and tell the user which
   outcome occurred, including the exact head SHA. Always report the merge-bot
   outcome when the gate ran. Do not post this external comment for an ordinary
   read-only status check or a watch that was not authorised to approach merge.
   When `MERGE_BOT_LOGIN` is unset, skip this step entirely.
7. **Exit — merge-ready:** checks green, zero unresolved threads, required
   approvals present, and either the App reviewed the latest meaningful range
   or `autofix` produced the bounded exact-head fallback receipt from
   `CONVENTIONS.md` when that convention exists. Re-fetch and paste the receipt
   (rule 7): the GraphQL unresolved-thread count from step 1 plus
   `gh pr view <n> --json headRefOid,statusCheckRollup,reviews,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus`.
   When `MERGE_BOT_LOGIN` is set, the final merge-bot gate must also have
   approved the exact current head: `headRefOid` must equal the commit SHA of
   that login's latest effective `APPROVED` review (later `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
   or `DISMISSED` on that head is not approval). If they differ, restart that
   gate. When `MERGE_BOT_LOGIN` is unset, skip the merge-bot SHA check. Report
   merge-ready and, when the gate applied, the merge-bot outcome; merge only if
   the user pre-authorised it.
8. **Exit — stuck:** the same substantive failure survives two full fix
   attempts, a known Critical/Warning finding remains, or a
   thread needs a judgement only the user can make. Stop the loop and report
   what is blocking, with the receipt. Bot silence, paused state, queueing and
   rate limiting are fallback conditions, not blockers. Do not grind. Attempt
   counts must survive compaction: keep a small state line per failure (failure
   key, head SHA, attempt number) in the wake log or a scratch state note, and
   re-read it after compaction — never re-derive "attempt 1" from memory.

## Reporting

One short line per wake in the transcript ("wake 3: 2 new CodeRabbit
threads → autofix; CI green"), full receipt only at exit. If the user asks for
status mid-watch, answer from a fresh fetch, not memory.

**Bad exit report:** "All comments addressed, should be good to merge."
**Good exit report:** "Merge-ready: 0 unresolved threads, 14/14 checks green,
1 approval (receipt below). Declined 2 CodeRabbit suggestions as out of
scope, replies posted."

## Gotchas

- A wake with nothing newer than the last push is a no-op — say so in one
  line and go back to sleep; do not re-litigate old threads.
- Do not turn CodeRabbit silence or a rate-limit countdown into a re-review
  loop. Delegate the exact head to `autofix` for one receipt-bound local
  fallback; never query quota, post review commands, no-op push, or revisit an
  unchanged range.
- Resolving threads from memory is the measured top failure: the exit receipt
  is mandatory, not decorative.
- Draft PRs get no bot reviews — there is nothing to babysit until it is
  ready. If the PR is a draft, report that and ask before `gh pr ready`
  unless the user's request already authorised it; a draft can be deliberate.
- Long watches must survive context compaction: re-read this skill and
  re-fetch state after compaction rather than trusting remembered counts.
