# PR Triage

GitHub-workshop skill. Origin-workshop triage is `origin-pr-triage` (Bugbot,
never CodeRabbit).

## Execution Backend

1. Verify `git` with `git --version` and `gh` with `gh auth status`.
2. Run `extract_pr_comments.py`, which calls plain `gh`, as documented below.
3. If either verification fails, STOP and report the failed check. For a `gh`
   failure, report verbatim: "`gh` is missing or unauthenticated. Install it if
   needed, run `gh auth login`, then retry."

Extract and analyze all PR comments to produce a prioritized action plan.

## Workflow

1. **Trigger timing** → Run right after PR open/update (or on demand) so feedback is triaged before ad-hoc fixes.
2. **Wait for CodeRabbit (repos with the App)** → CodeRabbit posts its review a
   few minutes after push. Triaging before it lands produces an incomplete
   comment set. If no CodeRabbit review is present yet, or a comment matches
   "Come back again in a few minutes" (in-progress probe — see `autofix`
   Step 3), wait and re-check before triaging. If nothing appears within ~10
   minutes of the last push, the App isn't installed on this repo — note that
   and continue.
3. **Freshness check** → Only triage checks and comments newer than the latest push; a review of a superseded commit describes code that no longer exists (outdated threads are already filtered by the script). Also check base drift: if `main` has moved materially under the branch, recommend rebase/merge before acting on feedback. If an overlapping PR appears to make this one obsolete, stop, report, and ask before closing anything (unless closure was pre-authorized).
4. **Extract comments** → Run `<skills-dir>/gh-pr-triage/scripts/extract_pr_comments.py <PR_URL_or_NUMBER>`
5. **Verify before classifying** → For each bot finding you would mark P0/P1, read the flagged source lines first. CodeRabbit and other AI reviewers are helpful but not always right — a finding that doesn't survive inspection goes to "Decline with reason", not the fix queue.
6. **Analyze** → Categorize and prioritize each actionable comment
7. **Classify** → Split into:
   - `Must-fix before merge` (true blockers)
   - `Optional/defer` (nice-to-have, stylistic, or low impact)
   - `Decline with reason` (invalid after inspection, or out of scope — see below)
   **Anti-scope-creep is the governing rule:** review feedback must not expand the PR beyond the user's original goal. Suggestions to refactor adjacent code, add features, or generalise "while you're here" are classified `Decline with reason` no matter how sensible they sound. A PR that triples in size while being babysat is a failure even if every comment was "addressed".
8. **Output** → Generate action plan in the format below. Every declined item needs a one-line reason; the downstream skill (`autofix` for CodeRabbit threads, `gh-address-comment` for the rest) posts that reason on the thread and resolves it — declined threads are never silently ignored.

## Comment Categories

| Category | Description | Priority Hint |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Security | Auth, validation, encryption issues | P0 |
| Breaking | API changes, behavioral changes | P0 |
| Bug | Logic errors, edge cases | P1 |
| Performance | Efficiency, scaling concerns | P1 |
| Architecture | Design patterns, structure | P2 |
| Code Quality | Style, maintainability, DRY | P2 |
| Testing | Missing tests, coverage gaps | P2 |
| Documentation | Comments, naming, clarity | P3 |
| Nitpick | Style preferences, minor suggestions | P3 |

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Must fix before merge. Security, breaking changes, major bugs.
- **P1 (High)**: Should fix. Performance issues, significant functionality problems.
- **P2 (Medium)**: Improve if time permits. Quality, maintainability.
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice to have. Style, minor optimizations.

## Output Format

```markdown
# PR Triage: [PR Title]

## Summary
- **Total comments**: X actionable (Y resolved)
- **Blockers**: N items require attention before merge
- **Must-fix now**: N
- **Optional/defer**: N

## Action Items

### P0 — Critical
#### [Short description]
- **File**: `path/to/file.py:L42`
- **Reviewer**: @username
- **Issue**: [What's wrong]
- **Action**: [Specific fix]
- **Validation**: [How to verify]

### P1 — High
[...]

### P2 — Medium
[...]

### P3 — Low / Deferred
[...]

## Dependencies
[If any items depend on others]

## Quick Wins
[Items that can be addressed in <5 min]

## Optional / Deferred
[Lower-priority items intentionally deferred]

## Declined (with reasons)
[Items judged invalid after source inspection, or out of the PR's original
scope — one-line reason each, to be posted on the thread at resolution time]
```

## Notes

- Skip resolved threads unless user requests them
- Group related comments into single action items
- Quote specific reviewer concerns when unclear
- Link to comment URLs for context

## Handoff to gh-address-comment

After producing the action plan, pass it directly to the `gh-address-comment` skill
to resolve must-fix items. Do **not** re-implement comment-addressing inline.
CodeRabbit-authored threads go to `autofix` instead — it fetches unresolved
CodeRabbit threads and applies fixes with per-change approval.

```
Skill: <skills-dir>/gh-address-comment/SKILL.md
Trigger: "address the open PR comments" or "fix the must-fix items"
```

Ops workers: load `gh-address-comment` explicitly before starting code changes.
Do NOT inline-implement git checkout + edit + commit logic — the skill handles it.


## Gotchas

1. **Do not inline-implement fixes after triage** -- triage produces an action plan only. Applying fixes is the job of `gh-address-comment`. Re-implementing checkout+edit+commit logic here creates duplicate, divergent workflows (this exact issue was logged 2026-02-23).
2. **Resolved threads are hidden by default** -- `extract_pr_comments.py` skips resolved threads unless explicitly requested. If a user asks 'why was X not addressed', re-run with resolved threads included before concluding the item was missed.
3. **Automated review bots inflate comment counts** -- tools like Copilot, Reviewdog, or custom bots can post dozens of nitpick comments. Triage these as P3 by default and group them into a single action item rather than one per comment. **Exception — CodeRabbit:** triage its findings by their stated severity, not as blanket P3 — its "Potential issue"/security findings are genuine P0/P1 candidates; only its nitpick/style class defaults to P3. Route CodeRabbit-authored threads to `autofix` (not `gh-address-comment`) in the handoff.
4. **Silent empty triage is wrong** -- if the script returns zero actionable comments, confirm that the PR number/URL was resolved correctly before reporting 'nothing to do'. A wrong PR number returns an empty list, not an error.

## Invocation

`extract_pr_comments.py` calls plain `gh`. Run from the repo root:

```bash
<skills-dir>/gh-pr-triage/scripts/extract_pr_comments.py <PR_URL>
```

## Changelog
- **2026-02-23**: Added `gh-address-comment` handoff note — evidence:
  agent:ops-4:main T20260223-2223-1 session re-implemented inline comment
  addressing instead of loading gh-address-comment skill; UPDATES.md
  improvement backlog item "gh-address-comment discoverability".
